      "During my experience, Iâ€™ve worked on a variety of automation and testing projects that made a real impact on both efficiency and collaboration. I built a Java-based regression testing tool with interactive HTML/JS reports that made it easier for teams to spot and resolve issues quickly, improving the reliability of trading platforms. I collaborated on developing an automation pack in Java and Cucumber to validate client trade flows, helping ensure more thorough test coverage. To round it off, I developed a Python tool that connected with JIRA APIs to automatically create and organize test cases in Zephyr, saving the team from repetitive manual work and letting them focus on higher-value tasks.",
